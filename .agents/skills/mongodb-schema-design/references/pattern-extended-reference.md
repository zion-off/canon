## Use Extended Reference Pattern

**Copy frequently-accessed fields from referenced documents into the parent.** If you always display author name with articles, embed it. This eliminates $lookup for common queries while keeping the full data normalized—best of both worlds.

**Incorrect (always $lookup for display data):**

```javascript
// Order references customer by ID only
{
  _id: "order123",
  customerId: "cust456",  // Customer reference by ID only
  items: [...],
  total: 299.99
}

// Every order list/display requires $lookup
db.orders.aggregate([
  { $match: { status: "pending" } },
  { $lookup: {
    from: "customers",
    localField: "customerId",
    foreignField: "_id",
    as: "customer"
  }},
  { $unwind: "$customer" }
])
// Repeated joins add avoidable work for a common list view
```

**Correct (extended reference):**

Embed frequently-needed customer fields directly in the order document: include a `customer` subdocument with `_id` (kept as a reference for full lookups), `name`, and `email`. The order list query returns customer display data without `$lookup`. Full customer data is still available via a targeted read to the `customers` collection when needed.

**Keeping cached data in sync:**

When the source field changes (e.g. customer name), update the source collection first, then update cached copies in the orders collection using `updateMany` on the embedded reference `_id`. This can be done synchronously or asynchronously via Change Streams / background jobs. For data that changes more often, add a `cachedAt` timestamp to the embedded subdocument so the application can refresh on read when the cache exceeds a staleness threshold.

**What to cache (extend):**

| Cache | Don't Cache |
|-------|-------------|
| Display name, avatar | Full bio, description |
| Status, type | Sensitive PII |
| Slowly-changing data | Real-time values (balance, inventory) |
| Fields used in sorting/filtering | Large binary data |

**Alternative: Hybrid pattern with cache expiry:**

Keep both a bare reference (`customerId`) and an optional cache subdocument (`customerCache`) with `name`, `email`, and `cachedAt`. On read, if the cache is missing or older than a threshold (e.g. one day), refresh it from the `customers` collection and write the updated cache back to the order.

**When NOT to use this pattern:**

- **Frequently-changing data**: If customer name changes daily, update overhead exceeds $lookup cost.
- **Large cached payloads**: Don't embed 50KB of author bio in every article.
- **Sensitive data segregation**: Don't copy PII into collections with different access controls.
- **Writes >> Reads**: If writes greatly outnumber reads, caching adds overhead.

## Verify with

```javascript
// Find $lookup-heavy aggregations in profile
db.setProfilingLevel(1, { slowms: 20 }) // Disable afterwards
db.system.profile.find({
  "command.aggregate": { $exists: true },
  "command.pipeline.$lookup": {
    $exists: true
  }
}).sort({ millis: -1 }).limit(10)

// Check how often lookups hit same collections
db.system.profile.aggregate([
  { $match: { "command.pipeline.$lookup": { $exists: true } } },
  { $project: { pipeline: "$command.pipeline" } },
  { $unwind: "$pipeline" },
  { $project: { lookup: { $getField: { field: { $literal: '$lookup' }, input: '$pipeline' } } } },
  { $match: { "lookup": { $exists: true } } },
  { $group: { _id: "$lookup.from", count: { $sum: 1 } } }
])
// High count = candidate for extended reference
```
