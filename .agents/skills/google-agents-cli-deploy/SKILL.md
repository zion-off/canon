# ADK Deployment Guide

> **Requires:** `agents-cli` (`uv tool install google-agents-cli`) — [install uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/index.md) first if needed.

> Prefer using the `agents-cli` commands throughout this guide — they wrap Terraform, Docker, and deployment into a tested pipeline. If your project isn't scaffolded yet, see `/google-agents-cli-scaffold` to add deployment support first.

## Deployment Target Decision Matrix

Choose the right deployment target based on your requirements:

| Criteria | Agent Runtime | Cloud Run | GKE |
|----------|-------------|-----------|-----|
| **Languages** | Python | Python | Python (+ others via custom containers) |
| **Scaling** | Managed auto-scaling (configurable min/max, concurrency) | Fully configurable (min/max instances, concurrency, CPU allocation) | Full Kubernetes scaling (HPA, VPA, node auto-provisioning) |
| **Networking** | VPC-SC and PSC supported | Full VPC support, direct VPC egress, IAP, ingress rules | Full Kubernetes networking|
| **Session state** | Native `VertexAiSessionService` (persistent, managed) | In-memory (dev), Cloud SQL, or Agent Platform Sessions backend | In-memory (dev), Cloud SQL, or Agent Platform Sessions backend |
| **Batch/event processing** | Not supported | Native trigger endpoints (Pub/Sub, Eventarc); see `/google-agents-cli-adk-code` | Custom (Kubernetes Jobs, Pub/Sub) |
| **Cost model** | vCPU-iours + memory-iours (not billed when idle) | Per-instance-second + min instance costs | Node pool costs (always-on or auto-provisioned) |
| **Setup complexity** | Lower (managed, purpose-built for agents) | Medium (Dockerfile, Terraform, networking) | Higher (Kubernetes expertise required) |
| **Best for** | Managed infrastructure, minimal ops | Custom infra, event-driven workloads | Full Kubernetes control |

**Ask the user** which deployment target fits their needs. Each is a valid production choice with different trade-offs.

> **Product name mapping:** "Agent Engine" / "Vertex AI Agent Engine" is now **Agent Runtime**. Use `--deployment-target agent_runtime`.

> **Ambient / scheduled / event-driven agents:** Agent Runtime does not support Pub/Sub, Eventarc, or Cloud Scheduler triggers. Use **Cloud Run** (recommended) or **GKE** for these workloads. See `/google-agents-cli-adk-code` Section 12 for the `trigger_sources` pattern.

> **OAuth / user consent agents:** Use **Agent Runtime** with Gemini Enterprise for agents that need OAuth 2.0 user consent (e.g., accessing Google Drive, Calendar, or other user-scoped APIs). Cloud Run does not currently support managed OAuth flows. See the `adk-ae-oauth` sample in `/google-agents-cli-workflow` Phase 2.

## Deploying to Dev

### Deploy Workflow

**Task tracking:** Deployment involves multiple sequential steps (infra setup, CI/CD configuration, deploy, verification). Use a task list to track progress through these steps — skipping one often causes failures in later steps that are hard to trace back.

1. If prototype (no deployment target), first enhance: `agents-cli scaffold enhance . --deployment-target <target>`
2. **Notify the human**: "Eval scores meet thresholds and tests pass. Ready to deploy to dev?"
3. **Wait for explicit approval**
4. Once approved: `agents-cli deploy`

> **Agent Runtime timeout recovery:** Agent Runtime deploys can take 5-10 minutes and may exceed command timeouts. If the deploy command is cancelled or times out, the deployment continues server-side. Run `agents-cli deploy --status` to check progress — poll every 60 seconds until it reports completion or failure.

**IMPORTANT**: Never run `agents-cli deploy` without explicit human approval.

> **Do NOT run `agents-cli infra single-project` before deploying.** It is not a prerequisite — `agents-cli deploy` works on its own. Run it separately if the user needs observability features (prompt-response logging, BigQuery analytics) — see `/google-agents-cli-observability`.

### Single-Project Infrastructure Setup (Optional — Advanced)

`agents-cli infra single-project` runs `terraform apply` in `deployment/terraform/single-project/`. Use this to **provision single-project GCP infrastructure without CI/CD** (service accounts, IAM bindings, telemetry resources, Artifact Registry). Also useful to test things in a single project before going to production. It is NOT required for deploying.

```bash
# Optional — provision infrastructure in a single GCP project
agents-cli infra single-project
```

> **Note:** `agents-cli deploy` doesn't automatically use the Terraform-created `app_sa`. Pass the service account via `agents-cli deploy --service-account SA_EMAIL` or `uv run -m app.app_utils.deploy --service-account SA_EMAIL` for Agent Runtime targets.

### Deploy Flag Reference

| Flag | Description | Targets |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `--project` | GCP project ID | All |
| `--region` | GCP region | All |
| `--service-account` | Service account email for the deployed agent | All |
| `--secrets` | Comma-separated `ENV=SECRET` or `ENV=SECRET:VERSION` pairs | Agent Runtime |
| `--update-env-vars` | Comma-separated `KEY=VALUE` environment variables | Agent Runtime, Cloud Run |
| `--agent-identity` | Enable [agent identity](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-agent-platform/scale/runtime/agent-identity) (Preview) | Agent Runtime |
| `--memory` | Memory limit (default: `4Gi`) | Cloud Run |
| `--port` | Container port | Cloud Run |
| `--iap` | Enable Identity-Aware Proxy | Cloud Run |
| `--image` | Container image URI (skips source build) | Cloud Run, GKE |
| `--no-wait` | Start deployment and return immediately | Agent Runtime, Cloud Run |
| `--status` | Check the status of a pending `--no-wait` deployment | Agent Runtime, Cloud Run |
| `--list` | List existing deployments and exit | All |
| `--dry-run` / `-n` | Print what would be executed without running it | All |
| `--no-confirm-project` | Skip project confirmation prompt | All |

Run `agents-cli deploy --help` for the full flag reference.

> **Advanced Cloud Run Deploys:** If you need features not exposed via `agents-cli` flags, use `--dry-run` (or `-n`) to print the full `gcloud` command, copy it, and add additional arguments as needed.

> **Project Confirmation:** If the project is resolved automatically (not passed via `--project`), the command will prompt for confirmation in interactive mode. Since agents typically run in non-interactive mode, you MUST pass `--no-confirm-project` to proceed if you are relying on automatic project resolution.

## Production Deployment — CI/CD Pipeline

For the full CI/CD pipeline setup guide — prerequisites, `infra cicd` flags, runner comparison, WIF authentication, pipeline stages, and production approval — see `references/cicd-pipeline.md`.

---

## Cloud Run Specifics

For detailed infrastructure configuration (scaling defaults, Dockerfile, FastAPI endpoints, session types, networking), see `references/cloud-run.md`. For ADK docs on Cloud Run deployment, fetch `https://adk.dev/deploy/cloud-run/index.md`.

For event-driven / ambient agent deployment on Cloud Run, see the [`ambient-expense-agent`](https://github.com/google/adk-samples/tree/main/python/agents/ambient-expense-agent) sample and `/google-agents-cli-adk-code` for the `trigger_sources` pattern.

---

## Agent Runtime Specifics

Agent Runtime is a managed Vertex AI service for deploying Python ADK agents. Uses source-based deployment (no Dockerfile) via `deploy.py` and the `AdkApp` class.

> **No `gcloud` CLI exists for Agent Runtime.** Deploy via `agents-cli deploy` or `deploy.py`. Query via the Python `vertexai.Client` SDK.

Deployments can take 5-10 minutes. Use `--no-wait` to start a deployment and return immediately, then check on it later with `--status`:

```bash
# Start deployment without blocking
agents-cli deploy --no-wait

# Check on progress later
agents-cli deploy --status
```

When `--status` detects the operation has completed, it writes `deployment_metadata.json` and prints the same success output as a normal deploy.

For detailed infrastructure configuration (deploy.py flags, AdkApp pattern, Terraform resource, deployment metadata, session/artifact services, CI/CD differences), see `references/agent-runtime.md`. For ADK docs on Agent Runtime deployment, fetch `https://adk.dev/deploy/agent-runtime/index.md`.

---

## GKE Specifics

For detailed infrastructure configuration (Kubernetes manifests, Terraform resources, Workload Identity, session types, networking), see `references/gke.md`. For ADK docs on GKE deployment, fetch `https://adk.dev/deploy/gke/index.md`.

---

## Service Account Architecture

Scaffolded projects use two service accounts:

- **`app_sa`** (per environment) — Runtime identity for the deployed agent. Roles defined in `deployment/terraform/iam.tf`.
- **`cicd_runner_sa`** (CI/CD project) — CI/CD pipeline identity (GitHub Actions / Cloud Build). Lives in the CI/CD project (defaults to prod project), needs permissions in **both** staging and prod projects.

Check `deployment/terraform/iam.tf` for exact role bindings. Cross-project permissions (Cloud Run service agents, artifact registry access) are also configured there.

**Common 403 errors:**
- "Permission denied on Cloud Run" → `cicd_runner_sa` missing deployment role in the target project
- "Cannot act as service account" → Missing `iam.serviceAccountUser` binding on `app_sa`
- "Secret access denied" → `app_sa` missing `secretmanager.secretAccessor`
- "Cloud SQL connection failed / Not authorized" → Runtime service account missing `roles/cloudsql.client`
- "Artifact Registry read denied" → Cloud Run service agent missing read access in CI/CD project

---

## Required Permissions for CI/CD Setup

- **`roles/secretmanager.admin`** granted to the Cloud Build service account (`service-<PROJECT_NUMBER>@gcp-sa-cloudbuild.iam.gserviceaccount.com`) in the CI/CD project. This allows Cloud Build to access the GitHub token stored in Secret Manager.

---

## Required APIs

The following Google Cloud APIs must be enabled in your project for the skills and deployment to work:

- **`cloudbuild.googleapis.com`** — Required for building container images and running CI/CD pipelines.
- **`secretmanager.googleapis.com`** — Required for managing secrets and API keys.
- **`run.googleapis.com`** — Required for deploying to Cloud Run.

Ensure these are enabled before running deployment or CI/CD setup commands:
```bash
gcloud services enable cloudbuild.googleapis.com secretmanager.googleapis.com run.googleapis.com --project=YOUR_PROJECT_ID
```

---

## Secret Manager (for API Credentials)

Instead of passing sensitive keys as environment variables, use GCP Secret Manager.

```bash
# Create a secret
echo -n "YOUR_API_KEY" | gcloud secrets create MY_SECRET_NAME --data-file=-

# Update an existing secret
echo -n "NEW_API_KEY" | gcloud secrets versions add MY_SECRET_NAME --data-file=-
```

**Grant access:** For Cloud Run, grant `secretmanager.secretAccessor` to `app_sa`. For Agent Runtime, grant it to the platform-managed SA (`service-PROJECT_NUMBER@gcp-sa-aiplatform-re.iam.gserviceaccount.com`). For GKE, grant `secretmanager.secretAccessor` to `app_sa`. Access secrets via Kubernetes Secrets or directly via the Secret Manager API with Workload Identity.

**Pass secrets at deploy time (Agent Runtime):**
```bash
agents-cli deploy --secrets "API_KEY=my-api-key,DB_PASS=db-password:2"
```

Format: `ENV_VAR=SECRET_ID` or `ENV_VAR=SECRET_ID:VERSION` (defaults to latest). Access in code via `os.environ.get("API_KEY")`.

---

## Cloud SQL Permissions (Manual Deployment)

When using Cloud SQL with Cloud Run in a **manual deployment** (e.g., adding `--add-cloudsql-instances` in non-Terraform setups), you must manually grant the `Cloud SQL Client` role to the runtime service account.

Without this, the deployment may succeed but fail at runtime with `cloudsql.instances.get` authorization errors.

```bash
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding YOUR_PROJECT_ID \
  --member="serviceAccount:YOUR_RUNTIME_SA_EMAIL" \
  --role="roles/cloudsql.client"
```

> **Note:** In full Terraform-managed setups (`infra cicd` / `infra single-project`), this role is configured and managed automatically.

---

## Observability

See the **agents-cli-observability** skill for observability configuration (Cloud Trace, prompt-response logging, BigQuery Analytics, third-party integrations).

---

## Testing Your Deployed Agent

The quickest way to test a deployed agent is `agents-cli run --url <service-url> --mode <a2a|adk> "your prompt"` — it handles auth, sessions, and streaming automatically (supports Agent Runtime and Cloud Run).

For advanced testing (custom headers, session reuse, scripting, load tests), see `references/testing-deployed-agents.md`.

---

## Deploying with a UI (IAP)

IAP (Identity-Aware Proxy) secures a Cloud Run service so only authorized Google accounts can access it. Support for IAP deployment via `agents-cli deploy` is planned for a future release.

For Agent Runtime with a custom frontend, use a **decoupled deployment** — deploy the frontend separately to Cloud Run or Cloud Storage, connecting to the Agent Runtime backend API.

For more information on IAP with Cloud Run, see the [Cloud Console IAP settings](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/securing/identity-aware-proxy-cloud-run#manage_user_or_group_access).

---

## Rollback & Recovery

The primary rollback mechanism is **git-based**: fix the issue, commit, and push to `main`. The CI/CD pipeline will automatically build and deploy the new version through staging → production.

For immediate Cloud Run rollback without a new commit, use revision traffic shifting:
```bash
gcloud run revisions list --service=SERVICE_NAME --region=REGION
gcloud run services update-traffic SERVICE_NAME \
  --to-revisions=REVISION_NAME=100 --region=REGION
```

Agent Runtime doesn't support revision-based rollback — fix and redeploy via `agents-cli deploy`.

For GKE rollback, use `kubectl rollout undo`:
```bash
kubectl rollout undo deployment/DEPLOYMENT_NAME -n NAMESPACE
kubectl rollout status deployment/DEPLOYMENT_NAME -n NAMESPACE
```

---

## Custom Infrastructure (Terraform)

**CRITICAL**: When your agent requires custom infrastructure (Cloud SQL, Pub/Sub, Eventarc, BigQuery, etc.), you MUST define it in Terraform — never create resources manually via `gcloud` commands. Exception: quick experimentation is fine with `gcloud` or console, but production infrastructure must be in Terraform.

For custom infrastructure patterns, consult `references/terraform-patterns.md` for:
- Where to put custom Terraform files (single-project vs CI/CD)
- Resource examples (Pub/Sub, BigQuery, Eventarc triggers)
- IAM bindings for custom resources
- Terraform state management (remote vs local, importing resources)
- Common infrastructure patterns

---

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Terraform state locked | `terraform force-unlock -force LOCK_ID` in deployment/terraform/ |
| GitHub Actions auth failed | Re-run `terraform apply` in CI/CD terraform dir; verify WIF pool/provider |
| Cloud Build authorization pending | Use `github_actions` runner instead |
| Resource already exists | `terraform import` (see `references/terraform-patterns.md`) |
| Agent Runtime deploy timeout / hangs | Deployments take 5-10 min; check if engine was created (see Agent Runtime Specifics) |
| Secret not available | Verify `secretAccessor` granted to `app_sa` (not the default compute SA) |
| Cloud SQL connection failed / 403 | Grant `roles/cloudsql.client` to the runtime service account when using manual deployments |
| 403 on deploy | Check `deployment/terraform/iam.tf` — `cicd_runner_sa` needs deployment + SA impersonation roles in the target project |
| 403 when testing Cloud Run | Default is `--no-allow-unauthenticated`; include `Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-identity-token)` header |
| Cold starts too slow | Set `min_instance_count > 0` in Cloud Run Terraform config |
| Cloud Run 503 errors | Check resource limits (memory/CPU), increase `max_instance_count`, or check container crash logs |
| 403 right after granting IAM role | IAM propagation is not instant — wait a couple of minutes before retrying. Don't keep re-granting the same role |
| Resource seems missing but Terraform created it | Run `terraform state list` to check what Terraform actually manages. Resources created via `null_resource` + `local-exec` (e.g., BQ linked datasets) won't appear in `gcloud` CLI output |
| Deployment failed or agent not responding | Check Cloud Logging: `gcloud logging read "resource.type=cloud_run_revision AND resource.labels.service_name=SERVICE" --project=PROJECT --limit=50 --format="table(timestamp,severity,textPayload)"` for Cloud Run, or `gcloud logging read "resource.type=aiplatform.googleapis.com/ReasoningEngine" --project=PROJECT --limit=50` for Agent Runtime |
| Agent returns errors after deploy | Open Cloud Logging in Console → filter by service name (Cloud Run) or reasoning engine resource (Agent Runtime) → look for Python tracebacks or permission errors in recent log entries |
